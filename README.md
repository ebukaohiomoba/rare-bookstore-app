- Flexbox
- CRUD operations
- Semantic HTML5 markup



### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```


### Continued development

My next step is to transform this project into a React app. The objectives would remain the same as well as the final product, but it will be built using React. Furthermore, as I grow comforatble with making API calls, I will be linking the book and employee tables to databases where the tables will be populated by a database. 

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-step-by-step-guide-to-getting-started-with-html-tables-7f43b18f962b/) - This helped me with HTML tables with providing a good baseline
